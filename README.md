## Summary
Create, read, update, and delete a restaurant's inventory with Inventory App. This project allows me to practice more with Express, Mongoose, and Pug (formerly known as Jade).

## Data Structure
Below is a simple layout of my data structure:
![data structure of Inventory App](https://github.com/TYLPHE/inventory-app/blob/main/readme-assets/inventory-application-structure.jpg)

The data structure is influenced by the [MDN express tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/mongoose#designing_the_locallibrary_models), which is what I'm using as a guide as I develop this app.
